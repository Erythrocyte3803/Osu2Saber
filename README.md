# Osu2Saber
This software converts osu beatmap files (*.osu) to Beat Saber beatmap files.

## ToDo
* The conversion (osu2BS) algorithm is still poor. Needs improvement for more fun.
* The ogg library is a bit slow and the output quality is bad. We may find faster conversion (mp3 to ogg) method for heavy users.

## Dependency
This software depends on the following open source libraries:
* [osuBMParser](https://github.com/Razacx/osuBMParser)
* [.NET Ogg Vorbis Encoder](https://github.com/SteveLillis/.NET-Ogg-Vorbis-Encoder)
